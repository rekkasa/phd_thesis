		{Aims The SCORE project was initiated to develop a risk scoring system for
		use in the clinical management of cardiovascular risk in European clinical
		practice.Methods and results The project assembled a pool of datasets from 12
		European cohort studies, mainly carried out in general population settings.
		There were 205 178 persons (88 080 women and 117 098 men) representing 2.7
		million person years of follow-up. There were 7934 cardiovascular deaths, of
		which 5652 were deaths from coronary heart disease. Ten-year risk of fatal
		cardiovascular disease was calculated using a Weibull model in which age was
		used as a measure of exposure time to risk rather than as a risk factor.
		Separate estimation equations were calculated for coronary heart disease and
		for non-coronary cardiovascular disease. These were calculated for high-risk
		and low-risk regions of Europe. Two parallel estimation models were
		developed, one based on total cholesterol and the other on total
		cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio. The risk estimations are displayed
		graphically in simple risk charts. Predictive value of the risk charts was
		examined by applying them to persons aged 45–64; areas under ROC curves
		ranged from 0.71 to 0.84.Conclusions The SCORE risk estimation system offers
		direct estimation of total fatal cardiovascular risk in a format suited to
		the constraints of clinical practice.}

		The PATH (Predictive Approaches to Treatment effect Heterogeneity) Statement
		was developed to promote the conduct of, and provide guidance for, predictive
		analyses of heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) in clinical trials. The
		goal of predictive HTE analysis is to provide patient-centered estimates of
		outcome risk with versus without the intervention, taking into account all
		relevant patient attributes simultaneously, to support more personalized
		clinical decision making than can be made on the basis of only an overall
		average treatment effect. The authors distinguished 2 categories of
		predictive HTE approaches (a “risk-modeling” and an “effect-modeling”
		approach) and developed 4 sets of guidance statements: criteria to determine
		when risk-modeling approaches are likely to identify clinically meaningful
		HTE, methodological aspects of risk-modeling methods, considerations for
		translation to clinical practice, and considerations and caveats in the use
		of effect-modeling approaches. They discuss limitations of these methods and
		enumerate research priorities for advancing methods designed to generate more
		personalized evidence. This explanation and elaboration document describes
		the intent and rationale of each recommendation and discusses related
		analytic considerations, caveats, and reservations.

		Evidence-based medicine is the application of scientific evidence to clinical
		practice. This article discusses the difficulties of applying global evidence
		(“average effects” measured as population means) to local problems
		(individual patients or groups who might depart from the population average).
		It argues that the benefit or harm of most treatments in clinical trials can
		be misleading and fail to reveal the potentially complex mixture of
		substantial benefits for some, little benefit for many, and harm for a few.
		Heterogeneity of treatment effects reflects patient diversity in risk of
		disease, responsiveness to treatment, vulnerability to adverse effects, and
		utility for different outcomes. Recognizing these factors, researchers can
		design studies that better characterize who will benefit from medical
		treatments, and clinicians and policymakers can make better use of the
		results.

		Prediction models are increasingly used to complement clinical reasoning and
		decision making in modern medicine in general, and in the cardiovascular
		domain in particular. Developed models first and foremost need to provide
		accurate and (internally and externally) validated estimates of probabilities
		of specific health conditions or outcomes in targeted patients. The adoption
		of such models must guide physician{\textquoteright}s decision making and an
		individual{\textquoteright}s behaviour, and consequently improve individual
		outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of care. In a series of two articles we
		review the consecutive steps generally advocated for risk prediction model
		research. This first article focuses on the different aspects of model
		development studies, from design to reporting, how to estimate a
		model{\textquoteright}s predictive performance and the potential optimism in
		these estimates using internal validation techniques, and how to quantify the
		added or incremental value of new predictors or biomarkers (of whatever type)
		to existing predictors. Each step is illustrated with empirical examples from
		the cardiovascular field.

		Often the literature makes assertions of medical product effects on the basis
		of ‘ p < 0.05’. The underlying premise is that at this threshold, there is
		only a 5\% probability that the observed effect would be seen by chance when
		in reality there is no effect. In observational studies, much more than in
		randomized trials, bias and confounding may undermine this premise. To test
		this premise, we selected three exemplar drug safety studies from literature,
		representing a case–control, a cohort, and a self-controlled case series
		design. We attempted to replicate these studies as best we could for the
		drugs studied in the original articles. Next, we applied the same three
		designs to sets of negative controls: drugs that are not believed to cause
		the outcome of interest. We observed how often p < 0.05 when the null
		hypothesis is true, and we fitted distributions to the effect estimates.
		Using these distributions, we compute calibrated p-values that reflect the
		probability of observing the effect estimate under the null hypothesis,
		taking both random and systematic error into account. An automated analysis
		of scientific literature was performed to evaluate the potential impact of
		such a calibration. Our experiment provides evidence that the majority of
		observational studies would declare statistical significance when no effect
		is present. Empirical calibration was found to reduce spurious results to the
		desired 5\% level. Applying these adjustments to literature suggests that at
		least 54\% of findings with p < 0.05 are not actually statistically
		significant and should be reevaluated. © 2013 The Authors. Statistics in

		Observational healthcare data, such as electronic health records and
		administrative claims, offer potential to estimate effects of medical
		products at scale. Observational studies have often been found to be
		nonreproducible, however, generating conflicting results even when using the
		same database to answer the same question. One source of discrepancies is
		error, both random caused by sampling variability and systematic (for
		example, because of confounding, selection bias, and measurement error). Only
		random error is typically quantified but converges to zero as databases
		become larger, whereas systematic error persists independent from sample size
		and therefore, increases in relative importance. Negative controls are
		exposure{\textendash}outcome pairs, where one believes no causal effect
		exists; they can be used to detect multiple sources of systematic error, but
		interpreting their results is not always straightforward. Previously, we have
		shown that an empirical null distribution can be derived from a sample of
		negative controls and used to calibrate P values, accounting for both random
		and systematic error. Here, we extend this work to calibration of confidence
		intervals (CIs). CIs require positive controls, which we synthesize by
		modifying negative controls. We show that our CI calibration restores nominal
		characteristics, such as 95\% coverage of the true effect size by the 95\%
		CI. We furthermore show that CI calibration reduces disagreement in
		replications of two pairs of conflicting observational studies: one related
		to dabigatran, warfarin, and gastrointestinal bleeding and one related to
		selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
		We recommend CI calibration to improve reproducibility of observational
		studies.

		Objectives To assess whether relative or absolute effect measures were used
		in subgroup analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and study whether
		conclusions would change if subgroup effects were calculated on a different
		scale than reported. Study Design and Setting We studied all 327 RCTs
		published in 2010 in five major medical journals. For trials with a
		dichotomous primary outcome, we extracted reported main and subgroup effect
		measures. If crude subgrouping data were reported, we calculated the subgroup
		effects on both relative and absolute scales. Results Of the 229 RCTs with a
		dichotomous primary outcome, 120 (52%) performed subgroup analyses. In 106 of
		these 120 (88%) RCTs, relative effect measures were used for subgroup
		analyses, whereas an absolute scale was used in 9 (8%) trials. Two (2%) RCTs
		reported both relative and absolute subgroup effects. Crude data of the
		subgroups could be extracted in 41 of the 120 (34%) RCTs. Calculating
		subgroup effects on a different scale than reported lead to a change in
		conclusion in 17% of the 41 trials. Conclusion Almost all RCTs used relative
		effect measures for subgroup analyses. Interpretation of subgroup effects,
		however, appeared to be dependent on whether relative or absolute effect
		measures were used.
