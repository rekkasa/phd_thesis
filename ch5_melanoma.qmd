## Abstract {.unnumbered}

**Purpose**: Based on recent advances in the management of patients with
sentinel node (SN)-positive melanoma, we aimed to develop prediction models for
recurrence, distant metastasis (DM) and overall mortality (OM).

**Methods**: The derivation cohort consisted of 1080 patients with SN-positive
melanoma from nine European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) centers. Prognostic factors for recurrence, DM and OM were studied
with Cox regression analysis. Significant factors were incorporated in the
models. Performance was assessed by discrimination (c- index) and calibration in
cross-validation across centers. The models were externally validated using a
prospective cohort consisting of 705 German patients with SN-positive: 473 trial
participants of the German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group study
(DeCOG-SLT) and 232 screened patients. A nomogram was developed for graphical
presentation.

**Results**:
The final model for recurrence and the calibrated models for DM and OM included
ulceration, age, SN tumor burden and Breslow thickness. The models showed
reasonable calibration. The c-index for the recurrence, DM and OM model was
0.68, 0.70 and 0.70, respectively, and 0.70, 0.72 and 0.74, respectively, in
external validation. The EORTC- DeCOG model identified a robust low-risk group,
with all identified low-risk patients (approx- imately 4% of the entire
population) having a 5-year recurrence probability of <25% and an overall 5-year
recurrence rate of 13%. A model including information on completion lymph node
dissection (CLND) showed only marginal improvement in model performance.

**Conclusions**:
The EORTC-DeCOG nomogram provides an adequate prognostic tool for patients with
SN-positive melanoma, without the need for CLND. It showed consistent results
across validation. The nomogram could be used for patient counselling and might
aid in adjuvant therapy decision-making

## Introduction {.unnumbered}

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system is the most widely
accepted approach to melanoma staging
[@gershenwald2017melanoma;@balch2009final]. Patients are classified into
distinct stages based on the tumor node metastasis criteria where nodal status
is based on number of positive lymph nodes after completion lymph node
dissection (CLND) in case of a positive sentinel node (SN) or after a
therapeutic lymph node dissection in case of clinically apparent nodal disease.
Recently there have been many advances in the care of patients with SN-positive
melanoma that also affect staging, namely CLND is no longer routine practice as
the Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-II (MSLT-II) and the German
Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group study (DeCOG-SLT) demonstrated no
survival benefit for CLND
[@faries2017completion;@leiter2016complete;@leiter2018final;@leiter2019final]
and as immune checkpoint inhibition and targeted therapy have been introduced in
the adjuvant setting with highly encouraging results
[@eggermont2018adjuvant;@long2017adjuvant;@weber2017adjuvant;@eggermont2016prolonged].
Consequently the AJCC staging system is likely to be less appropriate for
patients with SN-positive melanoma not undergoing CLND because of decreased
discriminatory ability [@verver2018risk] as the number of positive nodes after
sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not an independent prognostic factor
[@faries2017completion;@leiter2016complete] (in contrast to involved non-SNs
retrieved after CLND [@faries2017completion]). As a result, omitting CLND could
result in poorer risk stratification and impaired selection for adjuvant
therapy. On the other hand, SN tumor burden has been shown to be an independent
predictor of involved non-SNs
[@gershenwald2008microscopic;@lee2004factors;@murali2010non], and therefore SN
tumor burden may serve as a surrogate.

The objective of the present study was to identify independent prognostic
factors in a large European SN- positive melanoma population, using solely
information from the primary melanoma and the SLNB, to develop a prediction
model for recurrence, distant metastasis (DM) and overall mortality (OM),
presented in the form of a nomogram. The resulting model could aid in adjuvant
therapy decision-making. The prediction models were externally validated using a
large prospective German cohort.


## Patients and methods {.unnumbered}
### Cohort characteristics {.unnumbered}
#### Derivation cohort {.unnumbered}

The retrospective derivation cohort consisted of 1080 patients with SN-positive
melanoma who underwent SLNB between 1993 and 2008 in one of nine EORTC Melanoma
Group centers that have been previously collected and described
[@verver2018risk;@van_der_ploeg2011prognosis;@ophuis2017timing;@ophuis2016interval].
The current study only excluded duplicate cases ($n=2$), leading to a total of
1078 eligible SN-positive patients. The two duplicate cases concerned an error
in that database. The applied procedures have been described previously
[@verver2018risk].

#### Validation cohort {.unnumbered}

The prospective German validation cohort involved two sets of patients. The
first set consisted of 473 patients who were included in the DeCOG-SLT
multicenter randomised phase-3 trial comparing survival between patients with
SN-positive melanoma who did or did not undergo CLND [@leiter2016complete]. The
second set consisted of an additional 219 patients from a single center
(University Hospital, Tuebingen) who were initially screened for inclusion in
the DeCOG-SLT trial but were not included because of meeting the trial’s
exclusion criteria (e.g. head and neck melanoma, age >75 years), unwillingness
to participate, or no known reason. They also did or did not undergo CLND and
were followed and prospectively registered in accordance with similar protocols.
All patients had a tumor thickness of at least 1 mm and underwent surgery
between 2006 and 2014. The study design, applied procedures and follow-up
protocols have been described in detail elsewhere [@leiter2016complete]. There
was no overlap between the derivation cohort and validation cohort.

#### Outcomes {.unnumbered}

Outcomes of interest were first recurrence, first DM and OM. Time to recurrence
was calculated from date of SLNB to date of first recurrence or date of death by
any cause. Time to first DM was calculated from date of SLNB to date of first DM
or date of death by any cause. Time to OM was calculated from date of SLNB to
date of death by any cause.

#### Statistical analysis {.unnumbered}

The checklist proposed by the AJCC was used for guidance in building a
high-quality prediction model [@kattan2016american]. Associations between
possible prognostic factors and recurrence were studied with Cox regression
analysis. The following eight variables were identified as possible prognostic
factors based on clinical experience, literature review and availability of
sufficient data: sex, age, ulceration, location, histology, Breslow thickness,
total number of SNs removed and total number of positive SNs. To make efficient
use of available data, an advanced multiple imputation of missing values
strategy (5 imputations) was applied [@van_buuren2011mice]. This was done
separately for each derivation center to avoid using information of missingness
in cross-validation. The possible non-linearity of continuous variables was
modeled by logarithmic transformation. Independent prognostic factors were
selected with multivariable backwards selection. Linear predictor values (the
sum of truncated predictor values times their predictor effects) were scaled and
rounded to a risk score with integer values between 0 and 100. Because
recurrence, DM and OM are strongly related, the final recurrence prediction
model based on data from all nine EORTC centers was used as a basis for
predicting DM and OM, where the baseline hazard and the slope of the recurrence
prediction model were calibrated to DM and OM [@steyerberg2009clinical]. This
approach is beneficial as it provides a unique risk score for each individual
that translates into probabilities of all outcomes of interest, instead of
developing three independent prediction models. To test the validity of our
approach, we did develop these independent models and compared them with the
calibrated models. The absolute risk prediction of each outcome was plotted
against the risk score. To reduce overestimation of events occurring in patients
with extremely high scores, scores were truncated at an integer of 23,
corresponding to the 99th percentile of score distribution. Model performance
was assessed by examining discrimination and calibration. Discrimination was
measured using the concordance index (c-index); the closer to 1, the better the
discrimination, and a value of 0.5 indicates that the model is no better than a
chance [@harrell1996multivariable]. Calibration was assessed visually by
plotting the predicted probability against the actual observed frequency in
quintiles of predicted outcomes. A 45 line indicates perfect calibration (when
the predictive value of the model perfectly matches the patient’s actual risk).
Any deviation above or below the 45 line indicates under-prediction or
over-prediction, respectively. A nomogram was developed for graphical
presentation of the models. To evaluate generalizability of the models across
different centers, an internal-external cross-validation was performed in which
the model was fitted using data from eight centers and validated in the center
that was left out [@steyerberg2015prediction]. In addition we performed external
validation using the prospective German cohort. We first needed to develop a
model for recurrence where we replaced the continuous variable SN tumor burden
with the categorical substitute used in the prospective German cohort (single
cells, <0.5 mm, 0.5e1.0 mm, >1.0e2.0 mm, >2.0e5.0 mm and >5.0 mm). For the
derivation cohort, single cells were defined as <0.1 mm according to the
Rotterdam criteria [@van_akkooi2008sentinel]. Single cells in the validation
cohort were not specifically defined, but as the Rotterdam criteria were used
for measuring SN tumor burden, definitions are likely to correlate. The
performance of this altered model was compared with the final recurrence model
used for the nomogram. Subsequently the altered model was externally validated
with the 692 patients from the prospective German cohort. To test how much the
information on additional positive nodes retrieved after CLND would add to the
discrimination of the prediction model, we also developed a prediction model in
which the variable, additional positive nodes after CLND, was added. This model
was based on 1015 patients that underwent CLND in the derivation cohort.

Furthermore we calculated the model performance for recurrence, DM and OM of the
AJCC 7th edition classification, AJCC 8th edition classification and the simple
classification that was published previously (i.e. absent/present ulceration and
low/high SN tumor burden) was tested [@verver2018risk]. Lastly the observed
outcomes per group for all classifications were estimated using the Kaplan Meier
analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided, with a P < 0.05 considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) and R (version 2.15, R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2011).

## Results {.unnumbered}

The retrospective derivation cohort consisted of 1078 and the prospective
validation cohort of 692 patients with SN-positive. Patients in the validation
cohort had less extensive disease in terms of Breslow thickness, number of
positive SNs and tumor burden in the SN compared with those in the derivation
cohort (Table 1).

In the derivation cohort, recurrence at five years occurred in 496 patients
(46.0%), DM in 437 patients (40.5%) and OM in 364 patients (33.8%). Median
follow-up time for all survivors was 106 months (interquartile range [IQR]
61e130 months). In the prospective validation cohort, recurrence at five years
occurred in 267 patients (38.6%), DM in 223 patients (32.2%) and OM in 174
patients (25.1%). Median follow-up time for all survivors was 66 months (IQR:
48-94 months).

### Models for recurrence, distant metastasis and overall mortality {.unnumbered}

The final multivariable Cox model for recurrence after backwards selection
included four independent prognostic factors: ulceration, age, Breslow
thickness and SN tumor burden (Table 2). Logarithmic transformation of the
continuous variables adequately represented their effects. The c-index for the
final recurrence model was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65e0.70). In
cross-validation, the recurrence model was reasonably calibrated across nine
center in general, only in smaller centers there was substantial
underestimation of the risk (Fig. S1).

The association between linear predictors of recurrence and DM was of the same
size (calibration slope: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.87-1.16). The c-index for the
calibrated model for DM was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.67-0.72) and was reasonably
calibrated across nine  in cross-validation (Fig. S2). The performance of
this calibrated model, based on the baseline hazard and the slope of the
recurrence model, was similar to that of the independently developed prediction
model for DM (c-index: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.68-0.73)

The association between linear predictors of recurrence and OM was of the same
size (calibration slope: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.88-1.20). The c-index for the
calibrated model for OM was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.67-0.73), and was reasonably
calibrated across nine centers in cross-validation (Fig. S3). The performance
of this calibrated model was similar to that of the independently developed
prediction model for OM (c-index: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.68-0.73).

A four-item risk score was developed, assigning points to each prognostic factor
based on the magnitude of association with recurrence. A nomogram to calculate
the score and the risk of recurrence, DM and OM is presented in Fig. 1. The
scores were divided into four risk groups based on the 5-year probability of
recurrence: <25% (low risk; score 6-9; 4.1% of the population); 25-50%
(intermediate risk; score 10e15; 52.9% of the population); 50-75% (high risk;
score 16-19; 33.2% of the population); and >75% (very high risk; score 20e23;
10.0% of the population). The observed outcomes for recurrence, DM and OM per
risk group are shown in Table 3.

### External validation {.unnumbered}

For external validation purposes, an altered recurrence model was developed
using the categorized SN tumor burden variable used in the prospective German
cohort (Table S1). This altered model showed similar performance compared with
the final recurrence model (c- index 0.68, 95% CI: 0.65-0.70). In external
validation, the c-index for the altered recurrence model was 0.70 (95% CI:tumor
0.67-0.74), for DM 0.72 (95% CI: 0.68-0.75) and for OM 0.74 (95% CI: 0.71-0.78).
The calibration plots indicate good calibration, though there may be slight
underestimation for higher-risk patients in the recurrence and OM models (Fig.
S4).

### Additional prognostic value of CLND {.unnumbered}

An extended model for recurrence was created by adding the variable, number of
additional positive nodes after CLND, to the final recurrence model. This
extended model for recurrence had a c-index of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.67e0.72). The
calibrated extended models for DM and OM showed c-indices of 0.72 (95% CI:
0.69e0.74) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.69e0.75), respectively.

### Simple classification {.unnumbered}

A simplified version of the model stratifies patients into four groups based on
ulceration and SN tumor burden: 1) absent ulceration and $\leq$ 1.0 mm; 2)
absent ulceration and >1.0 mm; 3) present ulceration and $\leq$ 1.0 mm and 4)
present ulceration and >1.0 mm. The c-indices for this classification in
predicting recurrence, DM and OM were 0.63 (95% CI: 0.61e0.65), 0.64 (95% CI:
0.62e0.67) and 0.64 (95% CI: 0.61e0.67), respectively. The observed outcomes for
recurrence, DM and OM per risk group are shown in Table 3.

### The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classifications {.unnumbered}

Patients were classified based on the 7th AJCC classification into IIIA
$\leq$ 1.0 mm, IIIA >1.0 mm, IIIB and IIIC and based on the 8th edition into IIIA
$\leq$ 1.0 mm, IIIA >1.0 mm, IIIB, IIIC and IIID. The c-indices for predicting
recurrence, DM and OM for the 7th AJCC edition were 0.61 (95% CI: 0.59-0.63),
0.62 (95% CI: 0.60-0.65) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.59-0.65), respectively, and for the
8th AJCC edition 0.62 (95% CI: 0.59-0.64), 0.63 (95% CI: 0.60-0.65) and 0.63
(95% CI: 0.61-0.66), respectively. The observed outcomes for recurrence, DM and
OM for both AJCC classifications are shown in Table 3. A cross-table comparing
the patients staged in accordance with the AJCC classifications and the risk
groups based on the EORTC-DeCOG model is illustrated in Table 4. An overview
of c-indices for all the different models is presented in Table 5.

## Discussion {.unnumbered}

The present study developed and validated a nomogram to predict five-year
recurrence, DM and OM in patients with SN-positive melanoma, by solely using
information from the primary melanoma and SLNB. The resulting patient-specific
probabilities could be used to tailor adjuvant therapeutic strategies for
patients with SN-positive melanoma, without the prerequisite to undergo CLND
and thereby avoiding potential significant morbidity. The greatest contemporary
value of our prognostic nomogram is the possibility of identifying patients at
sufficiently low risk for recurrence, DM and OM in whom adjuvant therapy could
be omitted.

Although the FDA and EMA pragmatically approved adjuvant therapy for all
stage-III patients, it is still under debate which patients should not be
considered candidates. Patients with stage IIIA $\leq$ 1.0 mm (AJCC 7th edition)
were considered low risk in most adjuvant therapy trials and were therefore not
included (one even excluded all IIIA patients)
[@eggermont2018adjuvant;@long2017adjuvant;@weber2017adjuvant;@yokota2019adjuvant;@hauschild2018longer].
The current study indicates that when the AJCC 8th edition criteria are used for
defining IIIA $\leq$ 1.0 mm instead of the 7th edition, it results in improved
selection of low- risk patients in terms of predicted prognosis (e.g. 5-year
recurrence probability of 27% versus 32%, respectively). A recent study also
showed that including SN tumor burden to the 8th AJCC staging system has crucial
prognostic relevance [@satzger2019melanoma]. Of note our EORTC-DeCOG model is able to identify an
even more robust low-risk group, as all identified low-risk patients (which
approximately concerned 4% of the entire population after imputation) had a
5-year recurrence probability of <25% and an overall 5-year observed recurrence
rate of 13%. However, identifying more robust low-risk groups comes at the cost
of fewer patients being assigned low risk (see Table 4). Nonetheless a major
advantage of our EORTC-DeCOG model is that it provides a more continuous type of
predicted probabilities. As a result it is possible to derive risk groups based
on outcome probabilities and/or risk scores (e.g. low risk; scores 6--9;
recurrence probability of <25%) which is in contrast to the AJCC classifications
where exact patient/ tumor characteristics define the risk groups (e.g. IIIA
$\leq$ 1.0 mm: T1a/b-T2a + N1a-N2a with $\leq$ 1.0 mm SN tumor burden). In the
current study we choose to derive risk groups based on the recurrence
probability, as this seems the most relevant outcome in the context of selecting
patients for adjuvant therapy; other cut-off values and/or outcomes are
possible. In conclusion, the EORTC-DeCOG model not only outperforms the AJCC
classifications in terms of overall model discrim- ination (see Table 5), but
also seems to be able to identify a more robust low-risk group in whom it may be
justified to forego adjuvant therapy.

The previously published simplified model, based on ulceration and SN tumor
burden, harbored the least performance, though still reasonable, and showed
similar predicted prognosis for the low-risk group as the 7th AJCC edition.
Whether to implement a more complex model versus a less robust model is a
balance between performance and simplicity. In our opinion, the simple model
could serve as an easy user-friendly prognostic tool for daily clinical practice
and to generally inform patients, but for more adequate risk estimates and
decisions upon (adjuvant) treatment, we advocate using the comprehensive
EORTC-DeCOG model. Noteworthy, besides the common prognostic factors (i.e.
ulceration, Breslow thickness and SN tumor burden), the current study also
identified increasing age as an independent prognostic factor for recurrence, DM
and OM. This finding is supported by other studies reporting on the significance
of the patient's age [@kretschmer2011age].

Stratifying for ulceration and SN tumour burden only was previously demonstrated
to yield similar discriminatory ability for melanoma-specific mortality as
stratifying for AJCC sub-stages which included information on nodal status
after CLND [@verver2018risk]. The additional value of non-SN status retrieved after CLND
was also tested in the current study, by developing an extended model. This
model showed only marginal improvement in performance (e.g. c-index for the
recurrence model increased from 0.68 to 0.69), thereby indicating that omitting
CLND has very limited consequences for prognostication if SN tumor burden is
taken into account.

This study has several limitations. First is the retrospective design of the
derivation cohort, which has inherent biases. However, the models proved to be
successful in external validation. Performance was comparable between the
derivation and prospective validation cohort, even though the latter cohort
included patients with relatively better prognosis (e.g. less extensive disease)
and largely represents a clinical trial population. Adjuvant interferon-$\alpha$
therapy was intended in approximately 60% of the patients included in the
DeCOG-SLT trial, which is another possible limitation [@leiter2016complete]. It
could have potentially influenced outcomes, especially in patients with
ulcerated melanomas as ulceration seems to be a predictive factor for IFN
sensitivity [@eggermont2012long;@eggermont2016long]. Furthermore, it is unknown
how many patients in the validation cohort received effective novel therapy
after recurrence. Because patients were included from 2006 through 2014, it is
likely some patients did. As patients in the derivation cohort were included
from 1993 through 2008, novel therapies probably had limited effect. To date, no
novel biomarker has been validated that suffices to predict long-term clinical
benefits and subsequently could be incorporated in the models, despite efforts
in this drection (e.g. PD-L1) [@nishino2017monitoring]. In addition, other
prognostic factors such as mitotic rate or microsatellites could not be
incorporated in the present models because of insufficient data. Another
limitation is the inadequate representation of patients with SN-positive with a
head and neck melanoma in both cohorts. For the validation cohort this is
largely explained as it was an exclusion criterion in the DeCOG-SLT trial, and
for the derivation cohort this might be partially explained by the historical
concerns of poor safety, accuracy and prognostication. Similar numbers (~5%)
have been reported in other European cohorts
[@roulin2007prognostic;@richtig2020does], while particularly American cohorts
have reported higher numbers (>10%)
[@faries2017completion;@klemen2019completion]. With the introduction of adjuvant
therapies, the number of performed SLNBs in head and neck melanomas is likely to
increase.

Considering the advances in the management of patients with SN-positive
melanoma, it becomes highly relevant to have a prediction model that provides
precise patient-specific probabilities based on solely factors from the primary
melanoma and the SLNB. The EORTC-DeCOG nomogram is the first that meets these
demands, and as a result it could be used for patient counselling and assist in
trial design. In addition it might aid in adjuvant therapy decision-making. To
facilitate its use, an online calculator has been developed and can be accessed
at [https://www. evidencio.com/models/show/2010](https://www. evidencio.com/models/show/2010).

```{r fig-positiveSlnb, cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Nomogram and risk distribution. The curves refer to predicted recurrence, distant metastasis or overall mortality at 5 years. The histogram refers to the risk score distribution in the cohort; each bar represents the proportion of patients in the cohort that was assigned that specific score. The histogram was divided in four risk groups based on the risk of recurrence: low risk: <25%, intermediate risk: 25e50%, high risk: 50e75% and very high risk: >75%. The nomogram incorporates four factors: ulceration, age, SN tumor burden and Breslow thickness. To calculate an individual’s probability of 5-year recurrence, distant metastasis and overall mortality, values for the prognostic factors must be determined first (for example: absent ulceration, 35 years, SN tumor burden 0.8 mm and Breslow thickness 1.0 mm). Second, for each value the corresponding points can be obtained by drawing a line from each value towards the point axis (in example: 0, 1, 4 and 5 points, respectively). Third, the points must be added up to obtain the total risk score (in example: risk score of 10). Finally, the 5-year recurrence, distant metastasis and overall mortality probability can be read by moving vertically from the x-axis (total risk score) to the predicted risk curves and corresponding probabilities on the left y-axis (in example: 26% for recurrence, 20% for distant metastasis and 16% for overall mortality). The percentage of patients in the entire population (1078) that also had a total risk score of 10 can be determined from the histogram, as well as the corresponding percentage of patients on the right y-axis (in example: 7%)."}
