# Summary {.unnumbered}

In this thesis we focus on baseline risk and its utilization for guiding
medical decision making. Development of risk prediction models, i.e.
mathematical functions relating the presence of the outcome of interest to a set
of measured predictors (covariates), is crucial for personalizing outcome risk
and, consequently, individualizing treatment decisions. 

Overall results from randomized controlled trials or large observational studies
often do not apply to individual patients and mainly represent a summary of
heterogeneous individual treatment effects. If variation of these individual
effects is large, then reliance on overall estimates may result in sub-optimal
decisions. Evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity has been a focal point
of methods research in recent years. To this end, we systematically reviewed the
literature on predictive approaches for the evaluation of treatment effect
heterogeneity.

Baseline risk is an important determinant of treatment effect and, therefore,
can be directly used to predict individualized treatment benefits. Consequently,
we developed and compared methods for risk-based assessment of treatment effect
heterogeneity both on the randomized controlled trial and the observational
setting. Finally, in applications we used risk-based methods to better guide
medical decisions in the fields of melanoma, COVID-19, and osteoporosis
treatment.

In @sec-review we present the results of a literature review using a broad
search strategy, complemented by suggestions from a technical expert panel. We
classify the identified approaches into three categories (risk-based, treatment
effect modeling, and optimal treatment regime methods). Risk-based methods use
only prognostic factors to define patient subgroups, relying on the mathematical
dependency of the absolute risk difference on baseline risk. Treatment effect
modeling methods use both prognostic factors and treatment effect modifiers to
explore characteristics that interact with the effects of therapy on a relative
scale. Finally, optimal treatment regime methods focus primarily on treatment
effect modifiers to classify the trial population into those who benefit from
treatment and those who do not.

In @sec-framework we present a standardized framework for the evaluation of
treatment effect heterogeneity using a risk-based approach. The proposed
framework consists of five steps: 1) definition of the research aim, i.e., the
population, the treatment, the comparator and the outcome(s) of interest; 2)
identification of relevant databases; 3) development of a prediction model for
the outcome(s) of interest; 4) estimation of relative and absolute treatment
effect within strata of predicted risk, after adjusting for observed
confounding; 5) presentation of the results. We demonstrate the application  our
framework by evaluating heterogeneity of the effect of thiazide or thiazide-like
diuretics versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on three efficacy and
nine safety outcomes across three observational databases. We show that
patients at low risk of acute myocardial infarction receive negligible absolute
benefits for all three efficacy outcomes, though they are more pronounced in the
highest risk group, especially for acute myocardial infarction.

In @sec-simulation we present the results of an extensive simulation study for
the comparison of easily applicable risk-based methods for the prediction of
individualized treatment effects in the setting of randomized controlled trials.
More specifically, we compare models with a constant relative treatment effect,
models including a linear interaction of treatment with the prognostic index of
baseline risk, and models including an interaction of treatment with restricted
cubic spline transformation of the prognostic index. We also consider an
adaptive approach using Akaike's information criterion for automatically
selecting among the previous methods. We show that the linear-interaction model
has optimal or close-to-optimal performance across many simulation scenarios
with moderate sample size. The restricted cubic splines model requires strong
non-linear deviations from a constant treatment effect larger sample size. We
also demonstrate the application of these methods in actual data using the
dataset of the GUSTO-I trial.

In @sec-melanoma we developed prediction models for the management of patients
with sentinel node-positive melanoma. We first developed a model for recurrence,
which we then re-calibrated for the prediction of distant metastasis and overall
mortality, allowing for the prediction of all three outcomes from the same model
with adequate accuracy (AUC of 0.68, 0.70, and 0.70 for recurrence, distant
metastasis, and overall mortality, respectively). An important addition of these
models is that they do not require information on positive lymph nodes after
completion lymph node dissection, which is no longer routine practice for
sentinel node-positive melanoma patients. Finally, we provided a nomogram for
graphical presentation of our derived prediction models.

In @sec-covid we develop simple and valid models for predicting mortality and
need for intensive care unit admission in patients presenting at the emergency
department with suspected COVID-19. We use first-wave patients from March till
August 2020 for model development and second-wave patients from September till
December 2020 for model validation. We develop separate logistic regression
models for in-hospital death and for need for admission to the intensive care
unit, both within 28 days after hospital admission. We develop a simple model
with age, respiratory rate, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and urea
for the prediction of in-hospital death. For the prediction of admission to the
intensive care unit we re-calibrate the mortality prediction model including a
linear spline with a knot at age 70 to account for the decreasing chance of
admission to the intensive care unit for older patients. Our prediction model
displays good discrimination and calibration the development dataset, while it
also maintains good performance in our temporal validation analysis.

In conclusion, we separated methodological approaches to the assessment of
heterogeneity of treatment effect in randomized controlled trials into three
categories, these are, risk-based approaches, treatment effect modeling
approaches, and optimal treatment regime approaches. We successfully developed
and implemented a risk-based framework for the assessment of heterogeneity of
treatment effect in the observational setting. We showed, through extensive
simulations, that regression models with a linear interaction of baseline risk
with treatment provide a viable option for the prediction of personalized
treatment benefits with smaller sample sizes or moderately performing risk
prediction models. We showed that prediction models developed in chapters
@sec-melanoma and @sec-covid can be used to aid medical decisions in a timely
manner. Finally, the implementation of our standardized framework for risk-based
assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effect in the field of osteoporosis
uncovered the potential of our methodology, while it also demonstrated its
limitations due to the observational nature of the data.
