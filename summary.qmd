# Summary {.unnumbered}

In this thesis we focus on baseline risk and its use for guiding
medical decision making. Development of risk prediction models, i.e.
mathematical functions relating the presence of the outcome of interest to a set
of measured predictors (covariates), is crucial for personalizing outcome risk
and, consequently, individualizing treatment decisions. 

Overall results from randomized controlled trials or large observational studies
often do not apply to individual patients and represent a summary of
heterogeneous individual treatment effects. If variation of these individual
effects is large, then reliance on overall estimates may result in sub-optimal
decisions. Evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity has been a focal point
of methods research in recent years. To this end, we systematically reviewed the
literature on predictive approaches for the evaluation of treatment effect
heterogeneity.

Baseline risk is an important determinant of treatment effect and, therefore,
can be directly used to predict individualized treatment benefits. Consequently,
we developed and compared methods for risk-based assessment of treatment effect
heterogeneity both on the randomized controlled trial and the observational
setting. Finally, in applications we used risk-based methods to better guide
medical decisions in the fields of melanoma, COVID-19, and osteoporosis
treatment.

In @sec-review we presented the results of a literature review using a broad
search strategy, complemented by suggestions from a technical expert panel. We
classified the identified approaches into three categories (risk-based,
treatment effect modeling, and optimal treatment regime methods). Risk-based
methods use only prognostic factors to define patient subgroups, relying on the
mathematical dependency of the absolute risk difference on baseline risk.
Treatment effect modeling methods use both prognostic factors and treatment
effect modifiers to explore characteristics that interact with the effects of
therapy on a relative scale. Finally, optimal treatment regime methods focus
primarily on treatment effect modifiers to classify the trial population into
those who benefit from treatment and those who do not.

In @sec-framework we presented a standardized framework for the evaluation of
treatment effect heterogeneity using a risk-based approach. The proposed
framework consists of five steps: 1) definition of the research aim, i.e., the
population, the treatment, the comparator and the outcome(s) of interest; 2)
identification of relevant databases; 3) development of a prediction model for
the outcome(s) of interest; 4) estimation of relative and absolute treatment
effect within strata of predicted risk, after adjusting for observed
confounding; 5) presentation of the results. We demonstrated our
framework by evaluating heterogeneity of the effect of thiazide or thiazide-like
diuretics versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on three efficacy and
nine safety outcomes across three observational databases. We showed that
patients at low risk of acute myocardial infarction receive negligible absolute
benefits for all three efficacy outcomes, though these were more pronounced in the
highest risk group, especially for acute myocardial infarction.

In @sec-simulation we presented the results of an extensive simulation study for
the comparison of easily applicable risk-based methods for the prediction of
individualized treatment effects in the setting of randomized controlled trials.
More specifically, we compared models with a constant relative treatment effect,
models including a linear interaction of treatment with the prognostic index of
baseline risk, and models including an interaction of treatment with restricted
cubic spline transformation of the prognostic index. We also considered an
adaptive approach using Akaike's information criterion for automatically
selecting among the previous methods. We showed that the linear-interaction
model has optimal or close-to-optimal performance across many simulation
scenarios with moderate sample size. The restricted cubic splines model required
strong non-linear deviations from a constant treatment effect larger sample
size. We also applied these methods in actual data using the dataset of the
GUSTO-I trial.

In @sec-melanoma we developed prediction models for the management of patients
with sentinel node-positive melanoma. We first developed a model for recurrence,
which we then re-calibrated for the prediction of distant metastasis and overall
mortality, allowing for the prediction of all three outcomes from the same model
with adequate accuracy (AUC of 0.68, 0.70, and 0.70 for recurrence, distant
metastasis, and overall mortality, respectively). An important addition of these
models is that they do not require information on positive lymph nodes after
completion lymph node dissection, which is no longer routine practice for
sentinel node-positive melanoma patients. Finally, we provided a nomogram for
graphical presentation of our derived prediction models.

In @sec-covid we developed simple and valid models for predicting mortality and
need for intensive care unit admission in patients presenting at the emergency
department with suspected COVID-19. We used first-wave patients from March till
August 2020 for model development and second-wave patients from September till
December 2020 for model validation. The final model for predicting mortality was
based on age and logarithmic transforms of respiratory rate, C-reactive protein,
lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, and urea. For the prediction of admission to the
intensive care unit we re-calibrated the mortality prediction model. Our overall
mortality prediction model displayed good discrimination and calibration across
all hospitals in the development dataset (AUC in 4 hospitals 0.85 with 95% CI
0.81 to 0.88; 0.81 with 95\% CI 0.71 to 0.91; 0.86 with 95\% CI 0.82 to 0.90;
0.85 with 95\% CI 0.81 to 0.88), while it also maintained good performance at
temporal validation analysis (AUC in four hospitals: 0.82 with 95\% CI 0.78 to
0.86; 0.82 with 95\% CI 0.74 to 0.90; 0.79 with 95\% CI 0.70 to 0.88; 0.83 with
95\% CI 0.79 to 0.86). The resulting COPE models were implemented as a publicly
accessible web-based application and as independent mobile applications which
also included detailed description of the derivation of COPE, descriptions of
the derivation data and reported on model performance to ensure transparency.

In conclusion, we separated methodological approaches to the assessment of
heterogeneity of treatment effect in randomized controlled trials into three
categories, these are, risk-based approaches, treatment effect modeling
approaches, and optimal treatment regime approaches. We successfully developed
and implemented a risk-based framework for the assessment of heterogeneity of
treatment effect in the observational setting. We showed, through extensive
simulations, that regression models with a linear interaction of baseline risk
with treatment provide a viable option for the prediction of personalized
treatment benefits with smaller sample sizes or moderately performing risk
prediction models. We showed that prediction models developed in chapters
@sec-melanoma and @sec-covid can be used to aid medical decisions in a timely
manner. Finally, the implementation of our standardized framework for risk-based
assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effect in the field of osteoporosis
uncovered the potential of our methodology, while it also demonstrated its
limitations due to the observational nature of the data.
